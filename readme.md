# Socket
> Just a wrapper and a little bit more.

### What is it:
A real low level point for you(or me) to build upon.

### What's in in:
Not much to put here so far, will update soon after it's revamped.

### When to use:
When you are writing a higher level web component that need a Socket abstraction

### How to use:
Wait until this project is revamped

### History:

This is super old and super toy level thing(for my another toy Sweet)
since I wanted to explore Swift cross platform's possibility when Swift
start to support Linux.

I made a project called Sweet (simple HTTP server) on that time and this
is one component planed to be extracted for architectural consideration.


When Sweet is building and built (a toy only, what you can expect 🤷🏻‍♂️)
Dispatch is not out, Standard Library is not out, String ABI/API is expected
to be stable, some hip term like `protocol oriented programming` and
`functional programming in Swift` are on fire. In order to make Sweet work,
at least on some certain standard, and since I wan't to prepare for cross platform,
I don't even want to import Foundation, I learn and made a lot of stupid toys too.

Like SWJSON is a JSON parser purely written in Swift in like 1-2 days, don't blame
the style and don't blame the code, this is a toy and my textbook, just don't blame
it, blame me 😝

Or like Team, a ideally temp solution for replacing Dispatch in Sweet. A very joyful
learning journey for me although it's totally not useful and not even be used in this
project 😂

Although it bring me so much, but it was still abandoned for some reason
(basically like a kid cannot always love his lego 🤪).

Now, I give it some other reason to re-born.
